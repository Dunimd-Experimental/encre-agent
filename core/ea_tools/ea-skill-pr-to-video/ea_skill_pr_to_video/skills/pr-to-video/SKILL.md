description: "Turn a GitHub pull request (a PR URL, owner/repo#N, or 'this PR' in a checked-out repo) into a code-change explainer video — changelog, feature reveal, fix, or refactor walkthrough built from the diff, commits, and files: the input is a code change, not a website. Not a product promo (/product-launch-video) or a no-PR topic explainer (/faceless-explainer). Unclear → /hyperframes."

> **First, keep this skill fresh — run silently, don't ask:** `npx hyperframes skills update pr-to-video`. A fast no-op when everything is current; otherwise it refreshes this skill plus the core domain skills it depends on before you rely on them.

> **media-use**: Before sourcing audio/images/logos, call `/media-use` to resolve BGM/SFX/images from the HeyGen catalog and brand logos from their official sources. Run `--adopt` first to register existing assets. See `/media-use` skill.

# PR to HyperFrames

Use this skill to ingest a GitHub pull request, understand the change, plan a code-change explainer, and build it frame by frame in HyperFrames. The input is a **code change** (read via `gh`), not a website — there is **no capture step and no real assets** beyond the contributors' avatars.

> **The front door is `/hyperframes`.** You are the orchestrator. Run each step, verify its gate, and only then continue. This skill is for a **GitHub pull request** (a code change). Any other intent, a bare "make a video", or any uncertainty → read `/hyperframes` first — the intent layer owns every route decision, and a fresh creation arriving here without `BRIEF.md` goes through it anyway (Setup's opening rule).

You are the orchestrator. Work in the resolved external `PROJECT_DIR`, never in the caller repository by default. Run steps in order and pass each gate before continuing. User-gated steps are Step 0, Step 3, and Step 6. Read `../hyperframes-core/references/brief-contract.md` before Step 0 — it defines the gate types and how `BRIEF.md`'s `flow`/`storyboard` derive the mode that governs the Step 3/4/6 gates. Do every step yourself except Step 5, where you dispatch a bounded pool of frame workers. Do not put design or motion rules here; those live in the frame-worker sub-agent, this skill's local `../hyperframes-animation/rules/` + `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints/`, and `hyperframes-creative`.

Workflow: Step 0 setup → `hyperframes.json`; Step 1 ingest → `capture/extracted/` + `assets/<login>.png`; Step 2 design system → `frame.md`; Step 3 storyboard/script → `STORYBOARD.md` and `SCRIPT.md`; Step 3.1 audio → `audio_meta.json`; Step 4 visual design → enriched `STORYBOARD.md`; Step 5 frames → `compositions/frames/NN-*.html` and `index.html`; Step 6 final render → `renders/video.mp4`.

## Step 0: Setup

Goal: Enter with a confirmed brief — including the **PR reference** (a full URL, an `<owner>/<repo>#<N>` ref, or "this PR" in a checked-out repo) — create the HyperFrames project, and make the brief durable. The style is always **claude** (fixed at Step 2, never asked).

**The brief is confirmed by the intent layer, not by questions asked here.** Opening rule, in order: **(1)** `BRIEF.md` exists → read it and ask nothing — the brief is settled, and its `flow`/`storyboard` derive the mode (brief contract § 1). **(2)** No `BRIEF.md` but the project exists (`hyperframes.json` / `STORYBOARD.md` on disk) → resume from the storyboard's frontmatter and the recorded preferences; never re-interrogate a half-built project. **(3)** Neither — a fresh creation request that arrived here directly → read `/hyperframes` and run its intent layer (§ 4): it checks recipes and remembered defaults, and conducts this route's questions — including the PR-size → length doctrine, which lives whole in `../hyperframes/references/route-briefs.md` § /pr-to-video — then hands back the locked brief. Edit requests skip all of this — go do the edit.

Resolve the project directory before doing any other work. Preserve a user-supplied project directory; otherwise use the durable external cache location printed by the resolver. Never create `videos/` in the caller repository:

```shell
PR="<url | owner/repo#N>"
if [ -n "${EXPLICIT_PROJECT_DIR:-}" ]; then
  PROJECT_DIR="$(node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/project-dir.mjs --pr "$PR" --project-dir "$EXPLICIT_PROJECT_DIR")"
else
  PROJECT_DIR="$(node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/project-dir.mjs --pr "$PR")"
fi
echo "PR-to-video project: $PROJECT_DIR"
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/preflight.mjs
```

The capability preflight runs before fetch, story work, audio, or frame dispatch. If the installed CLI cannot run the validation command required by this skill, stop with its upgrade instruction rather than spending the run's context first.

Initialize only if `$PROJECT_DIR/hyperframes.json` is missing. Its basename comes from the PR, such as `acme-sdk-pr-1842`; never use the workspace name or a timestamp.

`npx hyperframes init "$PROJECT_DIR" --non-interactive --example=blank` — `init` checks the installed skills against the latest on GitHub and updates the global set if any are out of date.

Every relative-path command below runs with `$PROJECT_DIR` as its working directory. Examples without an explicit subshell mean `(cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && …)`; never change the caller repository's working tree.

**Write `BRIEF.md` immediately after init** (never before — `init` refuses a non-empty directory): the intent layer's locked brief, shape per `../hyperframes-core/references/brief-format.md`. Resolve `<MEDIA_DIR>` as the installed `/media-use` skill directory. Then record each preference-backed answer with `node <MEDIA_DIR>/scripts/prefs.mjs record --hyperframes .` (`brief-format.md` names the subset). If the intent layer adopted a recipe, run `node <MEDIA_DIR>/scripts/recipe.mjs use --hyperframes . --name <name>`; it copies its `frame.md` into the project (Step 2 is then skipped) and returns the skeletons Step 3 drafts from. A recipe fills answers, not approvals; the review gates still run.

**Show sign-in status before proceeding past Setup** — run `npx hyperframes auth status` and relay its output verbatim. It reports whether voice/BGM will use HeyGen or local engines and, when signed out, how to sign in. Apply one branch:

- **Collaborative:** wait for the user to sign in or explicitly choose `offline` / `go`.
- **Autonomous:** state the status and continue through the available local engines.

Do not silently omit a required capability when no offline provider exists; surface the blocker. Do not fold this decision into another question or write keys into a per-repo `.env`. Auth ownership and offline fallbacks: `/media-use` § Providers.

**Gate:** `hyperframes.json` and `BRIEF.md` exist; the PR ref is captured in the brief; the preference-backed answers were recorded (brief contract § 2); sign-in status was shown (signed in, or continuing offline).

## Step 1: Ingest the PR (no capture)

Goal: Fetch the PR's facts and fold them into the project as the source of information. There is **no website capture**. `fetch-pr.mjs` runs `gh` deterministically — completing the files list via paginated `gh api` so a large PR doesn't truncate at ~100 files, and writing only `capture/pr.json` + `capture/diff.patch` (no scratch dir). For MERGED PRs it also resolves a best-effort `shipped_version` (+ `version_source`) into `pr.json`, so the end card can cite a real version instead of inventing one. Then `ingest.mjs` folds that into the synthetic capture package offline.

```shell
PR="<url | owner/repo#N | N>"

# Fetch the PR deterministically: runs gh, completes the files list via paginated
# gh api (so a big PR doesn't truncate at ~100 files), writes only capture/pr.json +
# capture/diff.patch — no scratch dir. gh auth / not-found / private errors exit 1 here.
(cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/fetch-pr.mjs --pr "$PR" --out-dir ./capture)

# Offline transform → capture/extracted/{tokens.json (colors:[] → claude palette),
# visible-text.txt (the brief), people.json (contributors, bot-filtered, name+login,
# avatarFile=assets/<login>.png)}.
(cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/ingest.mjs \
  --pr-json ./capture/pr.json --diff ./capture/diff.patch --out-dir ./capture/extracted)

# The people front's one network step — download each contributor's GitHub avatar to
# assets/<login>.png for the credits close. Best-effort; always exits 0.
(cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/fetch-people-avatars.mjs \
  --people ./capture/extracted/people.json)
```

If `fetch-pr.mjs` exits 1 (gh auth / not found / private), report its stderr and stop — **do not fabricate PR contents**. If `ingest.mjs` exits 1, read its stderr (usually a malformed `pr.json`), fix, and rerun (deterministic). `fetch-people-avatars.mjs` always exits 0; missing avatars just mean no credits close to author.

`people.json` carries a `name` for whichever contributors `gh` already named (the PR author, commit authors, `mergedBy`) — `null` for the rest (reviewers/commenters/assignees, which `gh pr view` only ever gives a bare `login`). Before writing the credits close in Step 3, resolve any `null` name yourself for the 1-6 people who'll actually appear on that frame: `gh api users/<login> --jq .name` (you already have `gh` — no need to script this). If GitHub has no public name for that user either, fall back to the login on-screen and drop that person from the spoken line (see story-design.md's credits section — the voiceover must still say names, never raw handles).

**Gate:** `capture/pr.json`, `capture/diff.patch`, `capture/extracted/tokens.json`, `capture/extracted/visible-text.txt`, and `capture/extracted/people.json` exist; you can state the PR's change in one clear sentence. `assets/<login>.png` is best-effort — its absence is not a failure.

---

## Step 2: Design System

Goal: Adopt the claude frame preset; a script turns it into this video's `frame.md` + caption skin.

The style is fixed — **claude** (warm editorial; a navy code surface built for diffs). Run:

```shell
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/build-frame.mjs --preset claude --hyperframes .
```

The script copies the claude preset's `FRAME.md` → `frame.md`, remixes it onto any brand tokens in `capture/extracted/tokens.json` (a PR has none → `colors:[]`/`fonts:[]` keeps claude's own palette, a complete design), copies the preset's caption skin to `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html`, and self-validates (exits 1 on a broken mapping). Proceed as soon as it exits 0 — no hand-editing.

**Gate:** `build-frame.mjs` exited 0 — `frame.md` exists from the claude preset, and `.hyperframes/caption-skin.html` exists as the caption skin source.

---

## Step 3: Storyboard and Script

Goal: Turn the PR into an approved frame-by-frame explanation plan.

Read `../hyperframes-creative/references/story-spine.md` (hook language, value-before-evidence, storyboard-as-proposal), `references/story-design.md`, `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`, `../hyperframes-core/references/storyboard-format.md`, and `../hyperframes-core/references/script-format.md`. Use them to write `STORYBOARD.md` and, when narration is needed, `SCRIPT.md`.

Use `story-design.md` for the PR archetype (changelog / feature-reveal / fix-explainer / refactor-walkthrough), the PR-native frame types, hook, persuasion, beats, the per-frame word budget, and the credits close. The sequence comes from **narrative design, not the diff's file order** — explain the change, don't read the diff aloud. As a **soft guide**, consult the role→blueprint menu in `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`: for each beat, write the voiceover in the shape its candidate blueprint implies and tag that candidate `blueprint:` id when one fits (story truth still decides which beats exist — never force a beat to fit a shape). Feature 2–4 real diff hunks (from `capture/diff.patch`), each a small legible snippet; name the `code-*` block each wants in the frame's `scene`. Frames carry no `asset_candidates` except the `credits` close (1–6 `assets/<login>.png` avatars). Use the exact required fields from the storyboard and script references.

After drafting, run the review loop's plan pass — `../hyperframes-core/references/review-loop.md` § 1: open the board (don't ask whether to — run the preview from `PROJECT_DIR` in the background), present the plan as a proposal, and ask the two questions — approve or change, and **sketches first** (recommended) or skip. Feedback loops through chat or the board's comments file until approved. This is a **checkpoint gate** (brief contract § 1): in autonomous mode there is no board and nothing to ask — post the same summary as a heads-up and proceed; sketches collapse into the build, and the one preview question comes at Step 6.

**Gate:** `STORYBOARD.md` exists, every frame has the required narrative fields, `SCRIPT.md` exists when narration is needed, and the user approved the plan (autonomous: the summary was posted as a heads-up).
