
## Refresh and Cleanup

- **ScrollTrigger.refresh()** — recalculate positions (e.g. after DOM/layout changes, fonts loaded, or dynamic content). Automatically called on viewport resize, debounced 200ms. Refresh runs in creation order (or by **refreshPriority**); create ScrollTriggers top-to-bottom on the page or set **refreshPriority** so they refresh in that order.
- When removing animated elements or changing pages (e.g. in SPAs), **kill** associated ScrollTrigger instances so they don’t run on stale elements:

```javascript
ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t => t.kill());
// or kill by the id assigned to the ScrollTrigger in its config object like {id: "my-id", ...}
ScrollTrigger.getById("my-id")?.kill();
```

In React, use the `useGSAP()` hook (@gsap/react NPM package) to ensure proper cleanup automatically, or manually kill in a cleanup (e.g. in useEffect return) when the component unmounts.

## Official GSAP best practices

- ✅ **gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)** once before any ScrollTrigger usage.
- ✅ Call **ScrollTrigger.refresh()** after DOM/layout changes (new content, images, fonts) that affect trigger positions. Whenever the viewport is resized, `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` is automatically called (debounced 200ms)
- ✅ In React, use the `useGSAP()` hook to ensure that all ScrollTriggers and GSAP animations are reverted and cleaned up when necessary, or use a `gsap.context()` to do it manually in a useEffect/useLayoutEffect cleanup function. 
- ✅ Use **scrub** for scroll-linked progress or **toggleActions** for discrete play/reverse; do not use both on the same trigger.
- ✅ For fake horizontal scroll with **containerAnimation**, use **ease: "none"** on the horizontal tween/timeline so scroll and horizontal position stay in sync.
- ✅ Create ScrollTriggers in the order they appear on the page (top to bottom, scroll 0 → max). When they are created in a different order (e.g. dynamic or async), set **refreshPriority** on each so they are refreshed in that same top-to-bottom order (first section on page = lower number).

## Do Not

- ❌ Put ScrollTrigger on a **child tween** when it's part of a timeline; put it on the **timeline** or a **top-level tween** only. Wrong: `gsap.timeline().to(".a", { scrollTrigger: {...} })`. Correct: `gsap.timeline({ scrollTrigger: {...} }).to(".a", { x: 100 })`.
- ❌ Forget to call **ScrollTrigger.refresh()** after DOM/layout changes (new content, images, fonts) that affect trigger positions; viewport resize is auto-handled, but dynamic content is not.
- ❌ Nest ScrollTriggered animations inside of a parent timeline. ScrollTriggers should only exist on top-level animations.
- ❌ Forget to **gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)** before using ScrollTrigger.
- ❌ Use **scrub** and **toggleActions** together on the same ScrollTrigger; choose one behavior. If both exist, **scrub** wins.
- ❌ Use an ease other than **"none"** on the horizontal animation when using **containerAnimation** for fake horizontal scroll; it breaks the 1:1 scroll-to-position mapping.
- ❌ Create ScrollTriggers in random or async order without setting **refreshPriority**; refresh runs in creation order (or by refreshPriority), and wrong order can affect layout (e.g. pin spacing). Create them top-to-bottom or assign **refreshPriority** so they refresh in page order.
- ❌ Leave **markers: true** in production.
- ❌ Forget **refresh()** after layout changes (new content, images, fonts) that affect trigger positions; viewport resize is handled automatically.
